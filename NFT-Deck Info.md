## BlokCrafters WAX NFT-Deck

## Description
BlokCrafters is working on development of the WAX NFT-Deck. The WAX NFT-Deck will be a IOS/Android app that tracks the NFTs in a WAX users account. It will display all the users WAX Wallets NFTs from noteable authors on WAX, and also the price of the NFTs. There will be an account value displayed of all NFTs inside the WAX wallet. 

## The Problem 
Currently we do not see any consumer IOS/Andorid apps that have been created specifically for tracking, displaying, calculating and sharing a WAX NFT. Just like how every person in crypto has a Blockfolio type of wallet, we believe there will be the same for NFT tracking wallets that are like apps for example like Blockfolio BUT for NFTs. This is a perfect time to begin filling the gap so WAX users can have a variety of ways to view their NFT holdings on the go!
